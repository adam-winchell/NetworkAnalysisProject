Some ideas about directions for the project:

1. Imagine taking the county-level network as is and swapping the location of two counties. If we do this infinitely many times, we could (hopefully) treat this as a configuration model from which we could compare modularity scores. The "county-swapped" model would be our "null" model for intra-factor modularity.

2. For the regression models, we could compare to a baseline model where we try to predict a factor given the other factors in the same county. We could ask the question "how much does a given counties other factors soak up the predictability, or how much do we gain by using the spatial neighbors of a county?"
